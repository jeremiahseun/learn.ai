# About Dewon

> **"Stop studying. Start flowing."**

**Dewon** (pronounced *Dew-on*) is not just another AI tutor. It is a **Liquid Intelligence Engine** designed to cure the isolation and confusion of modern self-education.

We are building this because we believe that **confusion is painful**, and clarity should be immediate.

## 1. What is Dewon?

Dewon is an **Early Access** educational platform that pairs you with **Dew**, a visual AI companion. 

Unlike ChatGPT or traditional chatbots that simply spit out text, Dew functions like a brilliant professor sitting next to you with a blank piece of paper.

### The Core Loop:
1.  **You Speak:** You talk to Dew naturally. You can vent, stumble over words, or ask vague questions like *"I don't get this physics concept."*
2.  **Dew Listens:** Using advanced audio processing (Gemini Live), Dew captures not just your words, but your tone and hesitation.
3.  **Dew Draws:** This is the magic. Dew creates **The Canvas**—a real-time, shared whiteboard where it draws diagrams, flowcharts, and mind maps to visualize the answer.
4.  **You Flow:** The conversation adapts. If you say *"Wait, go back,"* Dew erases and redraws. If you say *"Give me an example,"* a new branch appears on the tree.

## 2. Why We Are Building This

The current state of learning is broken:
*   **Video Tutorials are Passive:** You watch for 20 minutes, zone out, and retain nothing. You cannot ask a video "Why?"
*   **Textbooks are Dry:** They are dense walls of text that offer no feedback.
*   **Private Tutors are Inaccessible:** They cost hundreds of dollars and aren't available at 2 AM when you are stuck.

**Dewon is the solution.** It is always on, infinite in patience, and visual by default. It turns the "solid" wall of information into "liquid" knowledge that flows into your mind.

## 3. Brand Identity: "Liquid Clarity"

Our design philosophy is **Illuminated Clarity**. We reject the cluttered, white-and-gray SaaS aesthetic in favor of a deep, immersive environment that feels like a "Flow State."

### Visual Language
*   **Deep Space:** Backgrounds are Slate-950 (`#020617`), simulating the quiet of deep thought.
*   **Bioluminescence:** Active elements glow with Cyan-400 (`#22d3ee`), like thoughts firing in a neural network.
*   **Glass & Water:** Panels are translucent. Animations are fluid and organic, never mechanical.

### The Persona: "Dew"
Dew is:
*   **Patient:** Never judges you for asking the same question twice.
*   **Visual:** Prefers to show, not just tell.
*   **Calm:** Speaks concisely and warmly.

## 4. Current Status: Early Access

Dewon is currently in a **Public Beta**.
*   **No Pricing:** We are not charging users during this phase. We want feedback, not credit cards.
*   **Waitlist:** Access is rolled out in waves to ensure server stability.
*   **Feature Set:** The core "Voice + Canvas" loop is live. Advanced features like "Deep Synthesis" (Math reasoning) are available for testing.

*Built for the curious. Built for the frustrated. Built for you.*
