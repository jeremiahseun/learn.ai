# Future Roadmap & World-Class Feature Concepts

To make **Learn.ai** visually stunning and functionally superior to any LLM wrapper, we should implement the following features.

## 1. Class Session Recording (The "DVR" for Learning)
*   **Concept:** Allow students to record their entire session (audio + whiteboard video) and replay it later.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Local Recording (MVP):** Use the browser's `MediaRecorder` API. We combine the `<canvas>` stream (video) and the `AudioContext` destination (audio) into a single `WebM` blob. The user downloads it immediately.
    *   **Cloud Recording (Pro):** Stream the `WebM` chunks directly to Supabase Storage.
    *   **Smart Playback:** Instead of just a video file, save the *event log* of the board (timestamped commands). Replaying the session actually "redraws" the lines on the canvas in real-time. This is vector-perfect and uses 1% of the bandwidth of a video file.

## 2. Smart "Homework" & Flashcards
*   **Concept:** The AI shouldn't just explain and leave. It should reinforce.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   After a session, the AI analyzes the transcript.
    *   It automatically generates 5-10 **Flashcards** (Spaced Repetition) based on concepts the user struggled with.
    *   It generates a downloadable **PDF Summary** of the lesson, including screenshots of the final whiteboard state.

## 3. "Magic Notes" (Real-time Transcription & Summarization)
*   **Concept:** Students shouldn't have to take notes while trying to listen.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A side panel that auto-populates with bullet points as the lesson progresses.
    *   "Click to Bookmark": User clicks a button, and the AI marks that timestamp and summarizes the last 30 seconds as a key takeaway.

## 4. Multiplayer "Study Hall"
*   **Concept:** Learning is social.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Allow a user to generate a unique link.
    *   A friend joins the room.
    *   Using **Supabase Realtime**, both users can see the same whiteboard.
    *   The AI acts as the moderator/tutor for *both* students simultaneously.

## 5. Voice Cloning & Personas (The "Einstein" Effect)
*   **Concept:** Make learning entertaining by changing the tutor's persona.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Use 11Labs or Google's advanced voice models to allow the AI to sound like famous historical figures (Einstein for Physics, Frida Kahlo for Art).
    *   The `BoardBrain` system instruction adapts to speak in their style.

## 6. Handwriting Recognition (OCR) to Math
*   **Concept:** The user writes a math problem with their mouse/stylus, and the AI solves it.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Send the stroke data to a vision model.
    *   Convert handwriting to LaTeX.
    *   AI solves the LaTeX equation and explains the steps on the board.

## 7. Interactive Widget Library
*   **Concept:** Beyond drawing static shapes, the AI should be able to spawn interactive widgets.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Graphing Calculator:** AI spawns a Desmos-like interactive graph.
    *   **3D Models:** AI spawns a rotatable 3D molecule or engine part (using Three.js).
    *   **Code Runner:** AI spawns a code editor where the user can run Python/JS.

## 8. Focus Mode (Neuro-Aesthetics)
*   **Concept:** An interface designed for ADHD/Focus-challenged students.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   "Cinema Mode" that dims everything except the board.
    *   Ambient Lo-Fi beats generated by the AI in the background (optional).
    *   Haptic feedback (vibration) on mobile when the user successfully grasps a concept.
