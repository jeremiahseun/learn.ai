# Dewon: Liquid Intelligence Engine

> **"Stop studying. Start flowing."**

Dewon is a next-generation AI-powered educational platform designed to eliminate the isolation and cognitive load of traditional self-education. It transforms static information into a dynamic, visual, and conversational "flow state" experience.

---

## 1. Project Overview

Dewon is built on the philosophy of **Liquid Clarity**. Unlike traditional chatbots or video tutorials, Dewon pairs the user with **Dew**, a visual AI companion that uses real-time audio and an infinite whiteboard (The Canvas) to explain complex concepts.

### The Problem
*   **Passive Learning:** Videos and textbooks are one-way streams where retention is low.
*   **Cognitive Overload:** Text-heavy explanations often fail to explain *relationships* between concepts.
*   **Isolation:** Self-learners lack the immediate feedback of a human professor.

### The Solution: "The Dew Loop"
1.  **Voice Interaction:** Users speak naturally to Dew (Gemini Live), sharing frustrations or vague questions.
2.  **Real-time Visualization:** Dew doesn't just talk; it draws. It uses a suite of "Visual Tools" to build flowcharts, plot graphs, and create timelines in real-time.
3.  **Contextual Awareness:** Users can upload PDFs or provide URLs, which Dew digests to provide hyper-specific tutoring.

## 2. Current Frontend Architecture

The application is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, utilizing a deep-space aesthetic powered by Vanilla CSS and Framer Motion.

### Current Screens (Live in Beta)

#### A. Landing Page (`/landing`)
*   **Role:** Conversion-focused entry point.
*   **Features:** Glowing bioluminescent animations, "Glassmorphism" UI, and the "Get Started" call to action.
*   **Design:** Slate-950 background with Cyan-400 accents.

#### B. Student Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
*   **Role:** The hub for session management and student profile.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Session Cards:** List of recent learning sessions with delete/open actions.
    *   **Quick Start:** One-click modal to start a new session with optional PDF context.
    *   **Profile Summary:** Displays student level (Beginner/Expert) and primary interests.

#### C. Session View (`/session`)
*   **Role:** The core "Liquid Intelligence" experience.
*   **Features:**
    *   **The Canvas:** An infinite, auto-scrolling whiteboard where the AI writes and draws.
    *   **Audio Pulse:** A visual representation of the user's voice and the AI's response (Gemini Live).
    *   **Tool-Driven UI:** The AI calls specialized tools (`draw_tree`, `plot_functions`, `draw_timeline`) to structure information.
    *   **Thinking HUD:** A "Heads-Up Display" that shows the AI's current processing state.

## 3. MVP Roadmap: Missing Screens & Features

To reach full MVP readiness, the following screens and flows are planned:

### 1. Authentication & Security (Priority: High)
*   **Current State:** Uses `localStorage` for profile persistence.
*   **MVP Target:** Integration with **Clerk** or **NextAuth** for secure Google/GitHub login.
*   **Screen:** `/login` & `/signup` with custom branding.

### 2. Knowledge Library (Priority: Medium)
*   **Description:** A dedicated space to manage long-term knowledge.
*   **Screen:** `/library`
*   **Features:**
    *   View all uploaded PDF documents.
    *   "Ask a question" directly from a document to start a session.
    *   Folder/Tag organization for different subjects.

### 3. Analytics & Mastery Hub (Priority: Medium)
*   **Description:** Visualizing the student's progress over time.
*   **Screen:** `/progress`
*   **Features:**
    *   Heatmap of "Flow Time" (learning hours).
    *   Skill trees generated by AI based on session performance.
    *   Subject mastery badges.

### 4. Subscription & Billing (Priority: High)
*   **Description:** Monetization through tiered access.
*   **Screen:** `/pricing`
*   **Features:** Plan comparison (Free vs. Pro) and billing management.

## 4. Payment & Subscription Flow

Dewon uses a tiered subscription model to manage high-compute costs of Gemini Live.

### Subscription Tiers
| Feature | Free (Droplet) | Pro (River) | Enterprise (Ocean) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Sessions** | 2 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Gemini Model** | Flash | Pro (Thinking) | Pro + Custom |
| **PDF Storage** | 3 Documents | 100 Documents | Unlimited |
| **Price** | $0 | $19.99/mo | Contact Us |

### Checkout Workflow (Frontend Implementation)
1.  **Pricing Selection:** User clicks "Upgrade" on the Dashboard or dedicated Pricing page.
2.  **Stripe Redirect:** The frontend calls a backend endpoint to create a `checkout_session`, then redirects to the hosted Stripe Checkout page.
3.  **Success Callback:** Upon successful payment, Stripe redirects the user back to `/dashboard?success=true`.
4.  **State Revalidation:** The frontend detects the success flag and triggers a user profile refresh to unlock Pro features.
5.  **Billing Management:** A "Manage Subscription" button in settings opens the Stripe Customer Portal for cancellations/upgrades.

## 5. Design System & Aesthetics (Consistency Guidelines)

To maintain the **Illuminated Clarity** aesthetic across the application, follow these design tokens and rules:

### Color Palette
*   **Surface:** `#020617` (Deep Space Slate) - Use for page backgrounds.
*   **Translucent:** `rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.7)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` - Use for cards and modals.
*   **Bioluminescent Cyan:** `#22d3ee` - Primary interactive elements, active states, and "Dew's" thoughts.
*   **Neural Indigo:** `#818cf8` - Secondary accents, connecting lines, and system progress bars.
*   **Warning Amber:** `#fbbf24` - Cautionary states or specialized "Thinking" modes.

### Typography
*   **Headings:** `Montserrat`, Sans-serif (700 weight). All-caps for section headers.
*   **Body:** `Inter`, Sans-serif (400 for text, 500 for buttons).
*   **Monospace:** `JetBrains Mono` - Used for equations and code blocks within the Canvas.

### UI Principles
*   **Glow & Elevation:** Use `box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.2)` instead of harsh borders.
*   **Fluid Motion:** All transitions should use `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` to mimic liquid movement.
*   **Minimalism:** Remove unnecessary borders. Use spacing and glowing separators to define hierarchy.

## 6. Advanced Feature: Deep Synthesis

Dewon implements a two-tier intelligence model:
1.  **Flow Mode (Gemini Live):** High-speed, low-latency audio/visual feedback for conversational learning.
2.  **Deep Synthesis (Gemini 3 Pro):** A "heavy lifting" mode for complex proofs, architectural diagrams, or deep historical analysis. In this mode, the UI enters a "Thinking" state with an expanded HUD, showing the hierarchical breakdown of the problem before rendering it on the Canvas.
